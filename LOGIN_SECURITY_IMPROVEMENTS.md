# Login Security Improvements

This document outlines the security improvements made to the login system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Unified Login Flow
- Removed duplicate `/login` component
- Standardized on `/account/login` as the primary login route
- Added redirect from old `/login` route for backward compatibility

### 2. Enhanced Security Features

#### Password Hashing
- Added BCrypt.Net-Next package for secure password hashing
- Implements industry-standard password hashing with salt
- Backward compatible with existing plain text passwords
- Uses cost factor of 12 for optimal security/performance balance

#### Rate Limiting
- Implements brute force protection (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- Per-username rate limiting
- Failed attempt tracking with automatic cleanup

#### Session Management
- Improved session timeout handling (30 minutes)
- Automatic session extension on user activity
- Secure session clearing on logout
- Session validation with timeout checking

### 3. Improved User Experience

#### Enhanced Login UI
- Modern Bootstrap-based design
- Better error messages and validation
- Loading states with spinners
- Form validation with proper error display
- Remember me checkbox (UI ready)
- Return URL support for seamless redirects

#### Authentication Components
- Created `AuthorizeView` component for route protection
- Session-aware navigation
- Graceful error handling

### 4. Code Organization

#### New Services
- `AuthenticationService`: Handles authentication logic, password hashing, and rate limiting
- Enhanced `SessionService`: Better session management with timeout support
- `PasswordUtility`: Helper class for password migration

#### Architecture Improvements
- Separation of concerns between authentication and user management
- Centralized security logic
- Improved error handling and logging

## Usage

### For Developers

#### Protecting Routes
```razor
<AuthorizeView RedirectTo="/account/login">
    <!-- Protected content here -->
</AuthorizeView>
```

#### Checking Authentication
```csharp
if (ServiceProviders.SessionService.IsLoggedIn())
{
    // User is authenticated
}
```

#### Password Migration
For existing installations with plain text passwords, use the `PasswordUtility` class to migrate passwords:
```csharp
var hashedPassword = PasswordUtility.HashPassword("plainTextPassword");
```

### Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Password Hashing**: All new passwords are hashed using BCrypt
2. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attacks
3. **Session Security**: Proper session timeout and management
4. **Input Validation**: Client and server-side validation
5. **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak information
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Gradual migration path for existing systems

### Configuration

Session timeout is configured in `Program.cs`:
```csharp
builder.Services.AddSession(options =>
{
    options.IdleTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30); // 30 minute timeout
});
```

Rate limiting settings can be adjusted in `AuthenticationService.cs`:
- Max attempts: 5
- Time window: 15 minutes

## Migration Notes

- Existing users with plain text passwords can still log in
- Passwords will be automatically migrated to hashed format on first login after update
- No database schema changes required
- Existing session handling remains compatible

## Future Enhancements

- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Password reset functionality
- Account lockout after repeated failures
- Audit logging for security events
- Remember me functionality implementation
- Enhanced password policy enforcement
